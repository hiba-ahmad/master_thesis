# Joint Master Thesis - Born into Darkness? Estimating Social Inequity in Electricity Consumption in India based


## **Executive Summary**

Electricity consumption, like other public services, is linked to human welfare, and is widely studied to understand variation in its usage across the world. In India, there has been a massive increase in electrification efforts since 2005, aimed at improving access, quality, and reliability of power supply, particularly in rural areas. However, socio-economic disparities based on a hierarchical caste system, colonialism, religion, gender, region, and language still persist despite affirmative public and legislative action. We use Night Time Light as a proxy for electricity consumption and use Census 2011 population data and projections to conduct OLS regression and longitudinal analysis using fixed effects regression for the period 2012-2021.

Our findings show that marginalised castes (scheduled caste and scheduled tribe) and religion (Muslims) on average use lesser electricity in comparison to their dominant counterparts. The effect is stronger for SCs and STs in the cross-sectional OLS model for 2012, while this effect becomes stronger for Muslims from 2014 in the panel regression models. Looking at the multi-year trend from the panel, we posit that the electricity consumption of Muslims has reduced in the past decade, while it has increased for the SCs and remained almost stagnant for the STs. The findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring consumption (annual electricity spending) with the use of 2019 IRES survey data. Even though our results are robust at the sub-district level, we interpret them with caution due to data quality issues. Our study addresses the paucity in recent quantitative estimations of social inequalities and provides a base for further causal research at higher spatial scales over longer periods of time.
