This session will introduce you to the modern data wrangling workflow with R and dplyr.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the dplyr package and data wrangling workflow, (2) show you the three key verbs of the pacakge, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
